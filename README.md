# Animated Icons Background

This is a web development project that features animated icons on a background using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

The project was created to demonstrate the developer's programming skills in using these technologies. The CSS is used to create smooth transition animations for the icons, making them more dynamic and engaging for users.

HTML was used to create the project's structure, organizing the content and defining the page layout. JavaScript was used for user interactivity with the animated icons.

One of the main features of this project is the use of animated icons in the background, adding a visually appealing and dynamic touch to the page.
